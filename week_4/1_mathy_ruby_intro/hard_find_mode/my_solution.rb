# U2.W4: Calculate the mode!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# -The input is an array of unknown elements
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# The output is the mode of the array - the element that is repeated the most
# This can be a string or a number
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
# 1) Define a method called mode that takes one argument, (array)
# 3) Create a default message if there is no mode, store that in a variable
#    called arrayMode that will be returned at the end of the method
# 4) Create an initial count variable and set it equal to 1
# 5) Create a counter variable
# 2) loop through the array and use the enumerable detect function to 
#    find the number of each element in the araray. store that number in a variable 
#    called count
# 3) If an item in the array has a higher count than the initial count, 
#    update arrayMode to be the that element in the array.
